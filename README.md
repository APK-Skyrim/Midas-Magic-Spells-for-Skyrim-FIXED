Midas-Magic-Spells-for-Skyrim-FIXED
===================================

I have noticed that with the original MidasSkyrim.esp that there was a ton of errors with certain areas and when i ran boss it sent me to MidasSkyrim_Compatibility_Patch link which although fixed the error with the original MidasSkyrim.esp  it introduced many other errors

So I took out the latest Creation Kit and ran the original esp and the MidasSkyrim_Compatibility_Patch and took the MidasSkyrim.esp and completely recreated forum id\\\'s and recreated each error and deleted the corrupted data parts and recreated new parts.

afterwords I ran the esp through TES5Edit_3_0_31_EXPERIMENTAL-25859-3-0-31EXP and cleaned up the esp a bit and fixed any dirty edits i may of introduced while trouble shooting the esp 

If you find any bugs introduced feel free to message me or post comment

This mod adds 60+ new and unique spell types.  It adds beam, spray and projectile attacks and as summonable player house. And I plan to do much more :)

This mod has several goals...

- Extend the Magic system of Skyrim without disturbing the current spell systems
- Maintain the balance of the combat system (WIP)
- Add a completely different way to obtain these spells from the normal system
- Add exciting quests and new worlds that make obtaining these spells fun (WIP)

Several reactors are spread around Skyrim.  These are used to combine ingredients to create the Midas Magic Spells.

Reactor Locations:
The Riverwood Trader
The Midden in the College of Winderhold
Hillgrund\\\'s Tomb

The vendor version is a bit behind at the moment.  Remember to turn off \\\"Save on Travel\\\" when using the Reactor Version.

- Reported Conflict with Rich Merchants mod and Vendor version. If you want to run both, use the Reactor version (see above)
- The spells aren\\\'t balanced yet.  This is just for testing/fun for now.
- Conjured items caused CTD in one test
- Polymorph Hare may not always work (problem with Guards and targets in combat)
- Dragonling doesn\\\'t fight yet
- Luggage doesn\\\'t carry items yet
  Note:This seems to be related to the game remembering older versions of the mod and is sporadic.   To mitigate this, either start a new game or Save before entering the Riverwood Trader or the Midden.

If you just want to get your hands on the spells without doing all the work there is a document on how to do this easily in the \\\"Miscellaneous\\\" section of the file downloads that explains how.
